# **Optimizing Feature Selection using Particle Swarm Optimization & Genetic Algorithm**

Feature selection is essential in machine learning for precision. This study compares three methods: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and a hybrid of both for feature selection. The MNIST dataset is used. No feature selection offered 46.54% accuracy whereas PSO offered 96.49% accuracy, GA achieved 94.23% accuracy, and the hybrid method had the highest accuracy at 96.83%. These evolutionary computing methods boost classification accuracy. Choosing the right features is crucial for improving how well classification models work. Methods based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and hybrid approaches have shown promising results in this area. This study offers valuable insights into feature selection techniques for machine learning experts and practitioners. It shows how evolutionary computing can improve the performance of models on the MNIST dataset.
